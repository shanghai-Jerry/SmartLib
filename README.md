# SmartLib
A Smart Library System is based on the Qt platform(Version 5.0), using Mysql Database(Version 5.4)

It includes four catalogues:

* WebQRC: A web application for generating QR Code.

* WebLogin: A web application for automatic login through a website

* Server: A server application, handling the requests from clients.

* Client: A client aplication, admin and other users can login through this.

You may open the Server and Client application with Qt5.0 or a higher version,and the WebLogin and WebQRC with vs2013 or a higher version.

It has operations
* Add
* Delete
* Update
* Search 

Those functions can be used to both readers and books.

Users can generate QR Code for themselves and of course books ( WebQRC's function),
, then readers can automatically login the system by scanning the QR Code through their mobile phone (WebLogin's function).
By scanning the books' QR Code, then can review the details of the books

You can manage plenty of informations of readers and books through this system in a very convenient way,
and it works efficiently. What's more improtant, The system can be easily installed.

Of course, the system still have some demerits.

Look forward to having a great improvment in furture.

Thanks for your support.
