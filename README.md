# SmartLib
A Smart Library System is based on the Qt platform(Version 5.0), using Mysql Database(Version 5.4)

it includes four catalogues:

* WebQRC: A web application for generating QR Code.

* WebLogin: A web application for automatic login through a website

* Server: A server qt application,it can accecp the connection from a client ,it's just for admin to login,but admin has the highest power.

* Client: A client qt aplication,admin and normal users can login both,it can send a connecting request to the server application and 
all operations already be done here must be confirmed by the running server application. 

You may open the Server and Client application with Qt5.0 or a higher version,and the WebLogin and WebQRC with vs2013 or a higher version.
If you want to show some datas and check out whether the application can work out,you may install a local database to support it,mysql5.4 is g good choice.

It based on the Qt platform(Version 5.0) , using Mysql Database(Version 5.4), has many functions such as 
* Add
* Delete
* Update
* Search 

Those functions can be used to both readers and books.
You can manage plenty of informations of readers and books through this system in a very convenient way,
and work efficient. What's improtant,The system can be easily installed,you just need to install the WebQRC and WebLogin application.After that, users can generate QR Code for themselves and of course books ( WebQRC's function),
, then readers can automatically login the system by scanning the QR Code through their mobile phone (WebLogin's function).
By scanning the books' QR Code, then can review the details of the books.

Of course, the system still have some demerits.

Look forward to having a great improvment in furture.

Thanks for your support.
